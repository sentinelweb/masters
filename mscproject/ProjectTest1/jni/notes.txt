TO DO#
* FFT Improvements:
 - sin/cos/tan lookup tables.
 - precompute W's.
 - maybe look for a better FFT algo before this.
 
* Assembler:
 - try out SIMD NEON instructions.

* Tempo:
 - IOI Histogram
 - look for multiples of base (i.e. 0.5x, 2x, etc)
 - beat strength evaluation?

* Beat Detection:
 - look at Machine learning and Agents course lectures
 
* Time Stretching
 - Get Phase Vocoder working
 - 
 
* General efficiency:
 - Downsample value (basic)
 - use QMF (Quadrature Mirror filter) e.g. Haar , CQF (Conjugate Quadrature Filter) - e.g Debauches
